### A brief description of my research
The purpose of my research is to enhance the capabilities of intelligence of machine learning by way of human-informed technology. Through its combination of the precision of machine learning with human input and values, we will be able to make more informed decisions and develop clear strategies and solutions to the challenges. <p>
In our previous work, we ask how well humans and a deep neural network (DNN) predicted the emergency decision. We have shown that the DNN out-performed humans for early time points, but had an equal performance for later time points. With Grad-CAM visualization technics, we found that the DNN could focus on the meaningful features (steering wheel and hill ridge) but could not capture the time importance.
